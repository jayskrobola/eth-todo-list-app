# eth-todo-list-app

This "Hello World" web3 app was created with assistance from [this Dapp University guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coQ5dg8wM2o).

This app demonstrates the ability to create a custom contract on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity language, and use a Node.js frontend to interact with the smart contract.

## Tools used
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/): To deploy and test the smart contract
- [Truffle Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/): For a test ethereum blockchain
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): To act as a user on the test blockchain
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): To create a frontend to interact with the blockchain
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): To write tests for the JavaScript application
- [Google](https://www.google.com/): To debug error messages since this tutorial is a bit out of date ðŸ˜‰
